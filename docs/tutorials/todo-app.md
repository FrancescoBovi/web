This tutorial will take you step by step through the most important features of Wasp.

While going through it, if you want to find more details on a specific topic, make sure to check [Basic Elements](language/basic-elements.md) chapter in the docs.

You can check out the complete code of the app we are about to build with Wasp [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/master/examples/tutorials/TodoApp).

If you are interested at any moment in what is Wasp actually generating in the background, take a look at `.wasp/out/` directory in your project.

:::note
If you haven't yet set up Wasp, check out [Getting Started](tutorials/getting-started.md) first for installation instructions, and then continue with the tutorial.
