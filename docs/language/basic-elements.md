## App

There can be only one `App` element per Wasp project. It serves as a starting point and defines global
properties of your app. Currently, it is very simple:

```css
app todoApp {
    title: "ToDo App"
}
```

#### `title: string`
Title of your app. It will be displayed in the browser tab, next to the favicon.
